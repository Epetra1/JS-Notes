            //basically without this, the verialble is just within the function or the scope but if you use this then you can access it 
            //from outside by creating an object of that function 
            //Example:
            function greeting(){
                name = 'chandra';// IMP This will be global veriable since we havent used let or var 
                console.log('Hello ! ', name)
            }
            greeting()

            console.log('Hello ! ', sandeshGreeting.name)//and access that name value outeside by creating object like above

            }
            obj.greet()// here since we havent pointed name with this prointer ... gloval veriable will be assigned ie 'chandra'

                }
            }
            obj1.greet() // this will print 'name' since we have pointed with this pointer
            //UNDER : as far as i have understood , this refrs to function name or object name or class name like this. meaning FunctionName.
